Reconciled person birth and date places with KIMA using Open Refine, still with primary Hebrew name as the identifier (no KIMA ID yet, TBA)
the unreconciled data is available as open refined projects, has to be reconciled manually. Some values are senseless (Bar Ilan University is probably not a birthplace) and are flagged. Stars are used to indicate data that has to be specifically verified for various reasons.
