# DiJeSt: Digitizing Jewish studies

Supported by Rothschild Foundation Hanadiv Europe, DiJeSt is an incubator for digital humanities work in Jewish studies. 
We are adapting a pipeline of cutting edge tools and platforms which will enable scholars and students to engage in digital projects, profiting and contributing to a collaborative open pool of Jewish studies resources.


With a selection of case study projects and collaborations, tools and tutorials we will share the know how and knowledge that enables empowering and transforming the core activities of the scholar:  Reading, analyzing and disseminating. 

## READ
Optical character recognition (OCR), OCR correction and model training for texts printed in the Hebrew letter in the various Jewish languages. We plan to:
* create ground truth sets with https://transkribus.eu, JOCHRE, possibly also Escriptorium
* suggest conversions between open access and open source tools to encourage flow of ground truth data ((page.xml, alto(2, 4 and more)

## PROCESS and ANALYZE
The data we curate and process will be made available for anyone to use. Moreover, we are building a live, collaborative repository of data: people, places, books and works relevant to Jewish Studies, encoraging any future project to use and contribute to it. 
Extracting information from text, structuring it and connecting it to  We plan to:
* develop tools for update, correction, linking and addition to the DIJEST LOD repository, and for manual, automated and moderated detection and extraction of data from texts (complementary to Wikidata and recogito, respectively)
* create tutorials on extracting data and structuring information.

 
## DISSEMINATE

Finally, we complement the pipeline by offering tutorials for visualizing, presenting and sharing the data and the knowledge gained from it.
